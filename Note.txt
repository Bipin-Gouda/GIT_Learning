1. Initialize a repo - Only creates a local Git repository (.git/ folder) in your project directory (so it does track changes as it has .git but it is not connected to online Github).
2. Publish to Github - Uploads (pushes) your local repository to a GitHub repository. If there isnt it creates one. (uses git CLI internally)
3. Will have to create folder on own in both the places or use CLI
4. You can have different folder names in your local system and on GitHub. The name of your local folder does not have to match the GitHub repository name.
5. Run: git branch -M main and push using git push -u origin main
    (If branch name in local is master and in github its main then you will get error so do above step to resolve it will name main locally as well)
6. Changes made in the old file
